                    We are a group of university students who shared the same problem – finding people to play sports with or organizing matches was always a hassle. This inspired us to create TerminBuddy – a platform designed to bring people together through sports. Whether you're looking to join a game or you're missing a few players for your own match, TerminBuddy makes it easy.
                    <br /><br />
                    Our mission is to simplify how people connect for sports activities. With our user-friendly system, you can quickly post available matches, search for others in your area, and build a community around your favorite sport. It’s more than just a scheduling tool – it’s a way to meet new teammates, make friends, and enjoy the game.
                    <br /><br />
                    From casual weekend games to competitive matches, we wanted to build something that helps everyone find their perfect team. TerminBuddy is about more than just filling a spot – it’s about enjoying sports, creating connections, and having fun.
